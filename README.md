# Sylheti Dictionary Backend

This is the backend for a dictionary of the Sylheti language, made by Ana√Øs Ahmed in combination with the SOAS University Sylheti Project. It provides a GraphQL API which allows for queries of the Sylheti lexicon - a list of possible queries will be added as it is built. You can find it [here](https://sylheti-backend.gigalixirapp.com/api/graphiql).
